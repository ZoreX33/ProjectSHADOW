Project SHADOW is a fictional and research-based initiative inspired by the concept of the SCP Foundation. It contains secret documents, archives, object reports, and incident logs that were never meant to be publicly accessible.

This site is unofficial and not affiliated with the SCP Foundation. We are creating our own universe, based on original ideas and a unique system of access levels, classifications, and anomalies.

About the System
Project SHADOW is an autonomous archive designed for the containment and analysis of anomalous phenomena, entities, and incidents. Access to materials is strictly regulated and depends on the user's clearance level. All unauthorized access attempts are logged and may result in sanctions.

The archive features unique objects, critical incidents, and leaked files that may contain hazardous or cognitively distorting information. Users are advised to exercise caution when interacting with materials and to follow all established safety protocols.

If you encounter anomalies within the system or discover suspicious files, report them immediately to the curator or the internal response unit.
